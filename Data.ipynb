    "We will develop a 5 mile radius for selecting the optimal location of our clients new office. Selecting the location consists of centering around mixture restaurants, nightclubs, etc... Furthermore, we shall select an area with middle to upper middle class demographics in order to match our clients main office. Combining these elements our client should be satisfied with our approach. \n",

    "After gathering all our data we will select three cities that satisfy the clients prerequisites and extract other information from city specific census websites. Using a foursquare account we will zero in on our 5 mile radius of optimal locals and deliver the verdict to the client. "
